# 🎵 Java WAV Audio Player

A simple and functional command-line audio player built in Java for playing `.wav` audio files. This project demonstrates how to handle audio playback using the Java Sound API, with options to play, stop, reset, and quit.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Play `.wav` files from a specified file path  
- ⏹️ Stop and reset playback  
- 🔁 Loop playback continuously  
- 📂 File existence check with error handling  
- 📥 Simple and clean command-line interface  
- 🛡️ Robust exception handling for unsupported files and audio issues  

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- Java 17+  
- Java Sound API (`javax.sound.sampled`)  
- Command-line interface  

## 📸 Interface

----Started Player---- 
Enter full path to your .wav file: C:\Users\YourName\Music\test.wav

P = Play
S = Stop
R = Reset 
Q = Quit 
Enter your choice: P

## 📂 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/JavaAudioPlayer.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

cd JavaAudioPlayer


3. Compile and run the program:

javac Player.java
java Player


4. Enter the full path to your .wav audio file when prompted.



✅ Sample Input Path

C:\\Users\\YourName\\Desktop\\sample.wav

> ⚠️ Only uncompressed .wav files are supported. Compressed formats (like MP3 or FLAC) will not work with the Java Sound API by default.



📌 Notes

This is a console-based app.

For GUI-based audio playback, you can extend this using JavaFX or Swing.

If you're interested in adding support for MP3 files, consider using external libraries like JLayer.


💡 Future Improvements

Add volume control

GUI using JavaFX

Playlist and folder support

MP3 format support using external libraries
